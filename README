                          Service Provider Base

  What is it?
  -----------

  I long thought of having some eclipse java project that would have the minimum
  software setup already for use. 
  For example, I would think of a dynamic web project having
  Maven,
  Spring,
  Configuration module,
  Webservice
  at a minimum.
  This project is aimed to create a SOAP based service
  that would have single entry point which would service different kind of requests.
  Plans are there to include REST based service at a later point of time.
  This project is a parent/child Maven project having 3 modules called
  wsres
  wsgen
  wsservice
  wsres would have resources that are common to wsgen and wsservice modules.
  wsgen would have generated java files using the wsdls and xsds in wsgen.
  wsservice is a Spring 3.x based project. 
  It uses Commons Configuration 1.9 to read the configuration files.
  It uses Apache CXF 2.6.0 to create webservices.
  It uses Log4j2 2.0 for logging.
  It uses HSqlDB 2.3.0 as repository that is started (in the network mode) from the Tomcat.
  It uses JDK 1.7 and Tomcat 8.
  
  I used Eclipse Kepler. However, any version of Eclipse would do.
  
  Setup
  -----
  You can import the project into your eclipse at the root level (ServiceProviderBase) directly from Git.
  Once imported, you can the choose the modules to import into Eclipse using General Projects
